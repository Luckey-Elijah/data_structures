# Data Structures

A series of projects, assignments, and *key* in-class notes I'm working/worked on in my Data Structures course.

These are openly available for anyone's use. They include many concepts of several data structure types, algorithm implementations, and several key concepts needed in real-world applications in programming/coding.
