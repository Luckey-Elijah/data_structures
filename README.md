# Data Structures

## Brief

A series of projects, assignments, and *key* in-class notes I'm working/worked on in my Data Structures course.

There is also a directory that currently contains my final exam study material (for my Data Structures course) so you can ignore that if you'd like.

## Current Use

These are openly available for anyone's use. They include many concepts of several data structure types, algorithm implementations, and several key concepts needed in real-world applications in programming/coding.

## Future Use

One of my personal goals is that I may become familiar with many different languages, algorithms, and data structures. So you can expect some existing structures implented in languages like Python, Go (a personal favorite), or possiby even Java. You may also expect *more* algorithms may appearances on.

## Existing Data Structures

This is a short list of the currently implemented data structures:

- trees

    - binary search trees
    - as
