# Data Structures

## Brief

A series of projects, assignments, and *key* in-class notes I'm working/worked on in my Data Structures course.

There is also a directory that currently contains my final exam study material (for my Data Structures course) so you can ignore that if you'd like.

## Current Use

These are openly available for anyone's use. They include many concepts of several data structure types, algorithm implementations, and several key concepts needed in real-world applications in programming/coding.

## Future Use

One of my personal goals is that I may become familiar with many different languages, algorithms, and data structures. So you can expect some existing structures implemented in languages like Python, Go (a personal favorite), or possibly even Java. You may also expect *more* algorithms may appearances on.

## Existing Data Structures

This is a short list of the currently implemented data structures and brief details:

- binary trees

  - structure:

    - contains one root node that is used for referencing the entire tree
    - all non-NULL nodes contain some stored data (such as integers or string)
    - a node can have up to two sub-nodes/children nodes

  - use/operations:

    - traversals: there are several different way to traverse a binary tree, I have implemented **inorder**, **preorder**, and **postorder** traversals (you can read more about them [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-traversals-inorder-preorder-and-postorder/ "Geeksforgeeks Traversals"))
