// Topics Covered:

// 	- know three different collision resolution policies for hashing
// 		- linear probing 
// 		- quadritic probing
// 		- seperate chaining
// 	- advantages/disadvantages of each of these
// 	- best-, worse-, and average-case runtimes (Big "O") 
// 		- insertion
// 		- retrieval
// 	- With separate chaining, does it make more sense to insert into the beginning of a linked list or the end?
// 		- considerations

// 	- trace through insertion of elements into a hash table using these different collision resolution policies
// 	- understand precisely how the probing mechanism works
	
// 	- know the serious flaws/shortcoming in a hash function if 
// 	- quadritic probing: how can know that insertion will find an empty position in the table
